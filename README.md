# FrontController-PHP
 My attempt to set up a simple Front Controller to handle all requests for pages (routes) and REST API requests.

I use following techs:
- VS Code
- Postman

Some of the articles i've read and used ideas from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6890200/what-is-a-front-controller-and-how-is-it-implemented
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/227658/front-controller-in-php
https://symfony.com/doc/current/create_framework/front_controller.html
https://webdevetc.com/blog/the-front-controller-design-pattern-in-php
https://www.php.net/manual/

My TODO list for the future:
- Create classes and instead use/instantiate them from a frontcontroller file, and include classes/functions from the Index-page.
- Add functionality to read att handle regardless of user input for example "admin" or "admin.php".
